# Enhancing Breast Cancer Diagnosis with DeepLearning-Based Image Classification

Breast cancer is a global health concern that has a
significant impact on the lives of women. The use of artificial
intelligence (AI) in healthcare has shown remarkable promise in
improving early disease detection. Deep learning (DL) techniques
have advanced in the medical field in recent years, paving the
way for more accurate and efficient breast cancer diagnosis. This work presents an approach by using deep learning to analyse
mammograms and histopathological images, with the goal of providing timely and reliable results to help healthcare professionals
make decisions.The models proposed have been fine-tuned
on a massive dataset of breast cancer images, allowing them to
accurately distinguish between malignant and benign cases. In
addition,  a sophisticated ensemble learning technique
to improve classification performance is presented. the findings
show that there is a significant improvement in the accuracy and
efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis.


## Dataset
